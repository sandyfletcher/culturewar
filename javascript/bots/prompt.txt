Your task is to design a high-performance AI bot for a real-time strategy game.
The Goal:
Your objective is to create a new, competitive AI bot that can consistently perform well against a variety of unknown opponents. The bot should be robust, adaptive, and its strategic decisions should be well-reasoned. You have complete creative freedom to determine the bot's core strategy.
The "Required Reading" (Your SDK):
root/javascript/GameAPI.js: The bot's "senses." This has powerful helper functions you can use to build sophisticated logic.
root/javascript/bots/BaseBot.js: The required abstract class your bot must extend. It includes a this.memory = {} object for persistent state.
root/javascript/config.js: The "physical laws" of the game universe, critical for accurate calculations.
root/javascript/Planet.js & root/javascript/TroopMovement.js: The structure of the game objects returned by the API.
Key Strategic Challenges to Consider:
State Management: How will your bot manage its state over time? A simple bot only knows the present. An advanced bot uses this.memory to track:
Game Phase: Does it behave differently in the early, mid, and late game?
Target Priority: Does it remember high-value targets or planets it has previously failed to capture?
Threat Assessment: Does it identify the most dangerous opponent and focus on them?
Risk vs. Reward: How will you balance the value of capturing a planet against the cost in troops and the risk of leaving your own planets undefended?
Adaptability: How does your bot's strategy change if it's winning versus losing? A truly advanced bot should not play the same way in every situation. For example, it might play more aggressively when ahead, or consolidate and look for counter-attacks when behind.
The Final Request:
Based on your chosen strategy and the provided SDK, please write the complete code for the new bot. The code should be fully self-contained in a single file named [YourModelName].js. Please add comments to your code explaining the high-level strategic choices you made and how you addressed the challenges above.
